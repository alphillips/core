# Core

Goals!
- Ideally, it will export scss, project including could choose to modify what they want to import
- Move it off uikit, move it all to material-ui, esp grid

To do!
- Update all projects with (radio/select/checkbox) npm component
- move page-alert into message component and remove from Core
- check what we are using in Headings and see if we can move the styles out
